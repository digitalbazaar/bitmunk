         <h2>Getting Started</h2>
         
         <p>
         First off you will need to
         <a href="https://bitmunk.com/home/join">get an account</a> by visiting
         Bitmunk.com and signing up for a free membership.
         </p>
         
         <p>
         Next you will need to find some music.
         <a href="http://bitmunk.com/browse">Browse our catalog</a> to find a
         song or album you'd like to purchase. Click on the PeerBuy button
         to start downloading from the Bitmunk marketplace. Your Bitmunk
         Personal Edition (BPE) software will launch and ask you to log in and
         start the purchase.
         </p>
         
         <p>
         Once you've selected your account and chosen how much you are willing
         to spend the BPE will contact sellers in the marketplace to request
         parts of the files. Your software may contact hundreds of different
         people around the world while it tries to find the best deal for you.
         </p>
         
         <p>
         Only once your download is complete will your BPE authorize and pay
         for the file, distributing payment amongst the artist and all of the
         fans who distributed pieces of the file to you.
         </p>

         <p>
         Music, movies, books and television are at the heart of any culture.
         With the advent of the Internet it became easy to spread this culture
         to the world between the fans, but no solutions were created to
         compensate the artists and other culture creators.
         </p>
         
         <p>
         Bitmunk's marketplace addresses the problem - we've created technology
         to allow fans to spread their favorite works in a peer-to-peer manner
         while still financially rewarding both the content creators and the fans.
